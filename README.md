# Balrog Bot

The Balrog Bot is my first Python project, an RPG Discord bot!

My goal is to make a completely functional bot, in a way you won't need any other bot to play an RPG in a Discord server. At the moment of the initial commit, it has the dice _roll_ command, and a _clear_ channel command.

## How to use the bot in your server*

In order to use the bot, you have to add it to your server first, using [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=858773713280434198&permissions=412585621584&scope=bot)

To just roll the dice, use "/roll" "d(number of faces)" e.g. /roll d20 => (x)
You can roll it more than once prefixing the number of rolls e.g. /roll 2d20 => (x)+(y)
And you can roll the dice with a bonus: /roll d20 +1 => (x+1)


## What's coming in the next updates

The first big thing i'm planning to add is a sheet feature, sou you won't need another application to handle this important part of any Tabletop RPG game!

## Suggestions

If you find a bug, please make an **issue**, unless it's a security flaw, in this case, send me an email!!!

If you want to make suggestions, or test this bot, dm me!
